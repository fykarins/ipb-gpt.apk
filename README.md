# 📚 RepoSight: Repository Insighter (IPB-GPT)

🚀 *An advanced scientific paper search application for campus repositories.*  
This project was developed as part of **Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka** (Oct 2024 – Present).

## 🌟 Project Overview
Current campus repository platforms often struggle with **deep and contextual searches**, limiting researchers’ ability to quickly find relevant references.  

RepoSight addresses this by integrating **cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP)** technologies such as:
- 🔎 **Embedding Models**  
- 🤖 **Large Language Models (LLMs)**  

With these, the app enables **precise searches** by:
- Topic  
- Keyword  
- Faculty  
- Paper title  

Users can also **interact with retrieved papers** to get:
- 📄 Summaries  
- 🔬 Method explanations  
- 📊 Findings discussions  

This tool aims to close a critical gap in academic research by improving search relevance and fostering **interactive, context-driven exploration**—boosting productivity and collaboration within the campus community.
